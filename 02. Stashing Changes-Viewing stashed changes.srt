1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,990
In last movie, we saw how to make an edit and then to put it into the stash.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,990
In this movie, we're going to see how we can view those changes in the stash.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,990
Once again, we're going to use the git stash command, that's going to be true for all of

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,990
the things that have to do with the stash, git stash followed by something else.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,990
Before we did git stash save, this time we're going to do git stash list, and that's going

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,990
to show us a list of the things that are in the stash.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,990
So here, there's one item in the stash, it's this line right here, stash @ sign, curly braces, 0.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,990
This is the way to refer to this item in the stash.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,990
Let's remember that, that's the syntax, stash @ sign, curly braces followed by a number.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,990
The number here is going to be 0,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,990
next one will be 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 and so on, so there're all going to be numbered.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,990
Next it tells us on shorten_title, that's the branch that I was on, when I put it in the

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,990
stash because the stash is going to be accessible even when I switch branches.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,990
So if I switch to my master branch, let's try that real quick, git checkout master, and

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,990
then I do git stash list.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,990
It's still there.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,990
The stash is available all the time.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,990
I can always pull from it.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,990
That makes it really handy, especially if you start to make a change on one branch,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,990
and then you realize this isn't the branch that you wanted to commit those changes to,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,990
you can put them in the stash, change your branches and then pull them back out of the stash again.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,990
Back to the listing, it tells us what branch we were on, when we first made the stash,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,990
and then it gives the description that we gave to it, so we'd know what where we stashing.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,990
Now we can see more information about each of those stashes by saying, git stash show,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,990
and then this name right here.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,990
Now it's a bit awkward to type the name, I know it is. It's stash, @ sign, curly braces, zero,

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,990
curly braces. That's how we refer to it.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,990
And it comes up and by default it shows us what's called diff stat.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,990
This is a stat about what changed in this file.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,990
So that's by default.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,990
If we want to see more information, we really want to use the -p option, which is show it

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,990
to us as a patch.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,990
A patch is a section of code that you can apply to different things to modify them and change them.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,990
So this is basically saying, show us the edits.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,990
The -p option, I'm going to clear the screen before I do it,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,990
and what we see is the typical diff that we're used to showing us the sets of changes.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,990
This is very similar to showing a commit.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,990
So now that we know how to put things into the stash, we know how to look at the stash

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,990
and see what's in there.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,990
Next thing is to be able to pull items out of the stash, and we'll do that in the next movie.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
