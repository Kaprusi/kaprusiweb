1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
We're going to start out by setting up a remote repository, and the way we're going to do

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,990
that is by signing up for an account at GitHub, that's http://github.com.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,990
GitHub is the most popular Git host.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,990
There are other ones out there, but they're a great one, and I think you should start

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,990
with them first before you started exploring other options.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,990
They offer free and inexpensive hosting plans.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,990
Free is going to be great for our purposes when we're just getting started, but then we can also

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,990
upgrade to very inexpensive plans later on as our needs grow.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,990
And one of the things that I love about GitHub is that not only do they provide reliable

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,990
hosting for our Git repository, but they also offer many other great features.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,990
For example, charts and graphs that show the state of all the different branches and the

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,990
commits that have been made, or graphs showing the activity on a project over time.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,990
Those kinds of bells and whistles make it a really nice choice.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,990
Now here I'm on the GitHub site.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,990
The design of the page may change over time, they certainly may update their web site after I record this.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,990
The thing I want to look for is the Signup and Pricing button, there's one there, and

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,990
there is a big one down here.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,990
They have a lot of different plans.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,990
The one we're going to be picking is the Free for open source plan, which is $0 a month.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,990
It's unlimited public repositories and unlimited public collaborators.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,990
That means that once we push our code up there to the repository, everyone can see it.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,990
People may not be looking at our repository, but if they wanted to, they can. It is browsable.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,990
For open source projects that's ideal,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,990
but if you want to have a private repository where you can put code that people can't see,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,990
let's say you're building a project for a client, it might not be something that you

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,990
want everyone to be able to see the commits that you're making on behalf of that client.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,990
In that case you would need a private repository, and that's what these other plans offer is

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,990
different levels of private repositories for you to use.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,990
For now we can start with a free account unless you already know that you want to go with

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,990
one of those others.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,990
So create a free account, and then we just have to enter some basic information.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,990
Username that we want to use, the Email Address, our Password, and then our Password a second

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,990
time, and then Create an account.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,990
That's really all there is to it.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,990
Now it may send you an email and want you to confirm that you are who you say you are

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:05,990
and things like that.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,990
Go ahead and follow all of those steps, and then sign in when you're finally all set up.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,990
Now do give some thought to your username, because this username is the name the collaborators

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,990
on projects are going to see as well.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,990
Once you've gotten your account created, and you've signed into it, the next thing we want

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,990
to do is we want to create a new repository.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,990
In order to connect to the repository we have to create it first.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,990
So on the GitHub site, create the new remote repository.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,990
Create a New Repo is right here.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,990
If I click that, it will come up and say, what do you want to call this repository?

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,990
Now you can call it anything you like, it should probably match your project name.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,990
I'm going to call it explore_california.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,990
A description here, so we can provide a description, it's completely optional.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,990
Let's say Website for Explore California.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,990
And then we have a choice, do we want to make it Public so that anyone can see what's in

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,990
it? We can still choose who can commit to it.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,990
They can't necessarily have access to it but they can see it.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,990
Or we can choose Private, which means that only we can do it.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,990
If I choose Private, then I have to upgrade my account, because I have to go from a free

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,990
account to a Micro account, if I don't already have that.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,990
If I choose Public, then you don't have to so that's what I'm going to pick.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,990
Now the next option we have to decide is do we want to initialize this repository with a README.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,990
If you remember back to when we first created our very first repository, the very first

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,990
step we did was we initialized the repository, and then we made our first commit.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,990
So then at that first point we have our first commit in the repository, it's sort of the

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,990
very basic first step, and it's very common to create that first step by putting a README

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,990
file in there just to get things started.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,990
So they're offering to do this for you automatically, so you can check that if you want.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,990
I'm going to leave it unchecked.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,990
It will also add a gitignore file for us if we want.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,990
So we can add a gitignore file to the repository, and we can pick, and you can pick based on

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,990
what kind of project you're going to be doing.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,990
It will pull from the repository of gitignore files that we looked at earlier and put those

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,990
in there for you.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,990
So those are two examples of the kinds of nice features that GitHub gives you.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,990
I'm not going to do either one of those though, I'm just going to click Create repository.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,990
So GitHub created the remote repository on their servers, and then they provide us with

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,990
some helpful setup instructions.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,990
So we've got Quick setup here, if you've done this kind of thing before, or the steps that

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,990
we want are down here, they give us two choices.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,990
Either create a new repository on the command line or push an existing repository from the command line.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,990
Since we have an existing repository, that's the step that we want to follow.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,990
Now you'll notice here these steps are basically the steps that we followed early on in order

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,990
to create the basic first commit of our repository, and the last two steps are basically the same

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,990
thing once we have an existing repository.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,990
It's also the same thing here, creating the init step that they offered to do for us on the last step.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,990
So we've already done it, we could do it ourselves from the command line again, or we can have GitHub do it.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,990
But the end result is that we have a repository and what we need to do then is git remote

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,990
add origin and then this address right here.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,990
This address is also up here.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,990
If you click HTTP, you'll see the exact one, HTTP, https, that's the one that you want

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,990
to make sure that you get, not the git@ github one, make sure that you get the HTTP one.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,990
The other one would be if you were logging in via SSH instead of via HTTP.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,990
Now don't worry about the exact syntax of this git remote add and git push, because

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,990
we're going to be talking about those in the next movies.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
